Predicting Loan Default Using Various Machine Learning AlgorithmsPreface
This is my first end-to-end data science project. It is about Predicting Loan Default Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms. In this case, the data was retrieved from kaggle.com.
Aim of The Project:
Objective:
•	Obtain Insight of Loan Status
•	Create Machine Learning Prediction
Data was retrieved from kaggle.com. The data is obtained as 32,581 rows.
Content
Flow of the step is involved:
•	Data cleaning (handling missing value and duplicated data)
•	Data Binning (creating new groups from various features)
•	Data Labeling (labeling using One Hot Encoding)
•	Modeling (using various model, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Neighbour, Decission Tree)
•	Hyperparameter Tuning (Data was tuned by using Grid Search)
•	Re-modeling.
There are some model to compare: K-NN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest then were tuned by using Grid Search.
Result
Conclusion:
The best machine learning model according to this project is Random Forest with precission : 96% and Recall : 71%. Loan to Income Ratio is the dominant factor for Loan Default. In addition, Interest Rate, Occupier, and Person Income are significant contributors to loan default.
Recommendation for action:
•	Adjusting loan principal limits, LTI < 40%
•	Adjusting rate of interest
•	Requesting additional documents
•	Adding additional approval processes
•	Targeting Low Risk Market Segment

There is no perfection in the world. Therfore, It is pleasure to receive positive feedback from the expert.
Thank You :)
