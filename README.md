# Predicting Loan Default Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms

Loan default is a critical issue for financial service companies. Besides impacting the company's working capital, loan defaults also affect the company's portfolio. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the detection system to prevent losses due to loan default cases. By predicting the loan default, it can prevent potential losses in financial service companies.

The data in this project is retrived from Kaggle.com. The are some model used in this project, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest then were tuned by using Grid Search.

## Result
### Conclusion:
The best machine learning model according to this project is Random Forest with precission : 96% and Recall : 71%. Loan to Income Ratio is the dominant factor for Loan Default. In addition, Interest Rate, Occupier, and Person Income are significant contributors to loan default.

## Recommendation for action:
-	Adjusting loan principal limits, LTI < 40%
-	Adjusting rate of interest
-	Adding additional approval processes
